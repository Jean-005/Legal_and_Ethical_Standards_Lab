## Scenario 1

*BankingCorp are one of the leading retail banks in the country, offering a full range of products including current accounts, savings products, credit cards and loans. They have in-depth knowledge of their customers' income, financial commitments and spending habits. They already offer some products where customers can pay a monthly fee and receive benefits in return. Some of these benefits include special offers from a curated list of third-party partners which customers can opt-in to receiving.*

*They have recently been approached by a payday loan company who want to send direct marketing to users struggling to pay their credit card bills. The loan company want to email the customers they feel would be most likely to use their services but acknowledge that manually identifying targets would be time-consuming and want to develop an algorithm to automate this. BankingCorp have given them access to their systems to test this algorithm, ensuring it works with real customer data. The loan company have had some negative publicity recently and so BankingCorp will not be announcing this new partnership publicly. Instead they will inform customers in an email explaining the changes to their terms and conditions.*


**Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?**

BankingCorp may be potentially violating GDPR laws through :

- **Data Sharing:** They are giving access to customer data to a third-party company without clear consent from the customers.
- **Automated Decision Making:** BankingCorp giving access to their systems to a third-party company to test an algorithm to target customers for marketing purposes without their explicit consent could be considered as automated decision-making, which is regulated under GDPR.
- **Transparency** BankingCorp not informing customers about their partnership with the payday loan company and their use of customer data for marketing purposes could be seen as a lack of transparency - a key principle of GDPR.
- **Purpose Limitation:** Using customer data for a purpose other than what it was originally collected for (e.g. sending marketing emails from the payday loan company) may not align with the principle of purpose limitation under GDPR.


**What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?**

- **Targeting Vulnerable Customers:** Allowing a payday loan company to target customers who are struggling to pay their credit card debts raises ethical questions about taking advantage of vulnerable individuals in financial distress. This could potentially lead to customers taking on high-interest loans that they may not be able to afford, worsening their financial situation.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The decision to not publicly announce the partnership and instead informing customers through changes in terms and conditions (which most never read) shows a lack of transparency. Customers have a right to know how their data is being used and shared, especially when it involves sensitive financial information.


**What could the company do to address these issues?**

Obtain explicit consent from customers regarding data sharing, be transparent with customers about any data sharing agreements and partnerships e.g. as with this payday loan company, BankingCorp could anonymise customer data before sharing it with the payday loan company to protect customer privacy, implement regular audits and monitoring processes to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations and ethical standards, and consider being more transparent about partnerships that involve customer data, especially if they could raise ethical concerns.

## Scenario 2
*The new mobile game Treasure Hunters has been taking the country by storm. Players are shown an illustrated map and must find the hidden treasure by following clues and solving puzzles. The quicker a player finds the treasure the more points they score and they can compare their scores with their friends. Five new maps are added every day and each map can be completed in a few minutes, with the low time commitment making the game a huge hit with casual players. There are many players who would like more puzzles, though.*

*The developers have been taken aback by the success of the game and are struggling to keep up with demand. They have had to spin up more servers and are looking to hire more engineers to keep working on content. That costs money though, and they are looking to monetise the game. Instead of adding new maps daily they will continually be adding more which players can unlock by completing existing maps. Players will be able to spend their points to unlock hints which will help them progress faster. Hints will also be available to purchase using real-world money, with the possibility of offering multi-buy discounts at a later date.*

**Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?**

There doesn't appear to be any explicit violations of GDPR law.

**What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?**

**Some of the monetisation practices of this gaming app:** Offering in-game hints for purchase using real-world money can be seen as exploitative, especially if these hints are essential for players to progress in the game. This could create a scenario where players who can afford to spend more money have an unfair advantage over others.

**Potential transparency issues:** Players should be clearly informed about the costs associated with purchasing hints and any potential discounts offered. A lack of transparency in pricing or misleading marketing practices could lead to player distrust.

**Data Privacy Issues:** Given that Treasure Hunters developers collect personal data from players for payment processing there could be ethical considerations around data privacy and security therefore players should be informed about what data is being collected, how it will be used, and they must be given the option to consent to the processing of this data.


**What could the company do to address these issues?**

Employ fair monetisation practises, provide clear and transparent information to their players about the costs associated with purchasing hints using real-world money, maybe offer alternative ways for players to earn hints through gameplay rather than solely relying on purchases, provide options for players to disable or limit in-game purchases to prevent excessive spending (especially for vulnerable groups), and prioritise data privacy and security by implementing measures to protect players' personal information that is collected during in-game transactions.

## Scenario 3
*friends.com is a new match-making service to help people socialise when they move to a new area. Users enter their area and a list of their interests before being shown a list of people with similar interests in the area. There's no guarantee of an exact match in interests and the suggested friend could be on the opposite side of the city. Users can freely view each others' profiles and message each other, but the matching service will speed up the process of making new contacts. The site is free with revenue coming from generic banner ads on the page.*

*Their development plans involve adding a premium membership which will lock many of the existing features behind a paywall. Free users will only be able to view limited versions of profiles and have a daily cap on the number of matches which can be made. Premium users, on the other hand, will now have more specific location settings and be able to filter their matches. To advertise the premium service the free-tier users will be given occasional "trial periods" of the premium tier followed by adverts showing them what they could unlock by subscribing. Additionally the generic banner ads will be replaced by more targeted advertising for local businesses. Users' location data will be shared in order to ensure relevant businesses are being advertised.*


**Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?**

- **Data Sharing:** Sharing users' location data with third parties for advertisement purposes could raise issues regarding data sharing and consent requirements under GDPR.

**What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal?**

- The company's collection and sharing of users' personal data, including location data, for advertising purposes raises privacy concerns. It's possible that users may not be fully aware of how their data is being used and shared, which can lead to a lack of transparency and potential privacy violations.

- Providing occasional 'trial periods' of the premium tier followed by targeted adverts to entice users to subscribe can also be seen as manipulative. Users could feel pressured or misled into upgrading to a paid subscription - can raise ethical questions about the company's marketing practices.

- Allowing users to freely view each other's profiles and message each other without adequate security measures in place can pose risks to users' personal information.

- Although this platform aims to connect users with similar interests in a specific area, there really is no guarantee of an exact match. Users may form expectations based on the suggested matches, only to find that the connections are not as expected.

**What could the company do to address these issues?**

Clearly communicate and obtain explicit consent from users about how their data will be collected, used, and shared, provide detailed privacy policies and terms of service that are easily accessible to users, implement robust security measures to protect users' personal data from unauthorised access or breaches, given that users can freely view each other's profiles and message each other, their platform must ensure the security and confidentiality of users' personal data as is required by GDPR, friends.com can also ensure that their advertising practices are transparent and do not manipulate or pressure users into upgrading to premium memberships.
